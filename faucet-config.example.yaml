    <h5>What is a PoW Faucet?</h5>
    This is an Ethereum Faucet running on the Goerli Testnet.<br>
    To prevent malicious actors from exhausting all available funds or 
    accumulating enough Ether to mount long running spam attacks, 
    this faucet requires some mining work to be done in exchange for 
    free testnet funds.
  </div>
  <div class='pow-info'>
    <h5>How does this work?</h5>
    Just enter your ETH Address and start mining. 
    When you've collected enough ETH, stop mining and claim your rewards.
  </div>
  <div class='pow-info'>
    <h5>How to help the faucet?</h5>
    Replenish the faucet by sending funds you don't need anymore to:<br>
    {faucetWallet}
  </div>

# random secret string that is used by the faucet to "sign" session data, so sessions can be restored automatically by clients when faucet is restarted / crashed
